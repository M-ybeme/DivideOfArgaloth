                            <li>Anferdale is a quaint, secluded village nestled along the shore of a large, serene lake fed by a nearby waterfall. Though modest in size, Anferdale boasts a picturesque landscape with gently rolling hills, fertile farmlands, and fishing docks where locals cast lines and set nets. There is an ancient wall that stands to inhuman height and spans the gap between the mountain ranges that run to the ocean on either side of the river. Most of the townsfolk rely on farming and fishing for their livelihoods, making Anferdale feel both self-sufficient and deeply connected to the surrounding natural environment.</li>
                            <li>The townspeople are largely close-knit, with a few influential families that hold sway in local affairs. Anferdale is governed by a city council and safeguarded by a small but competent town guard.</li>
                            <li>Most of the families in town or those who live on nearby farms have deep ties to this area. They hear news about the outside world long after the events have come to pass. Those who live in the area have rarely lived elsewhere, and those who move to the area find this an ideal location to settle down and sometimes start a family.</li>
